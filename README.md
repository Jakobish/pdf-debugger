This tool allows you to inspect the tree structure of a PDF file. It is built
using the [Mozilla PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) library. I made a
fork of the project and extracted only the core part of it and published it as
separate npm package [pdf.js-core](https://github.com/hyzyla/pdf.js-core)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
